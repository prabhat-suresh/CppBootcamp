# Programming Challenge - Wordle Solver

### Problem Statement

Wordle is a popular word game in which the player has to guess a five-letter word.

- Check out the rules and play today's [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html). You can play multiple games at [Wordly](https://wordly.org/) to get a hang of the game.
- The challenge is to build a wordle solver that can assist you in solving the game.

> [!TIP]
> Check out the [wordle bot](https://ybenhayun.github.io/wordlebot/) to get an idea of what's expected from your wordle solver.

##### Guidelines
