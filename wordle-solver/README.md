# Programming Challenge - Wordle Solver

### Problem Statement

Wordle is a popular word game in which the player has to guess a five-letter word.

- Check out the rules and play today's [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html). You can play multiple games at [Wordly](https://wordly.org/) to get a hang of the game.
- The challenge is to build a wordle solver that can assist you in solving the game.

> [!TIP]
> Check out the [wordle bot](https://ybenhayun.github.io/wordlebot/) to get an idea of what's expected from your wordle solver.

##### Guidelines

- This is the [list](WordleAnswersList.txt) of all possible wordle answers and this is [set](FiveLetterWords.txt) of all possible valid guesses.
- Your wordle solver can be written in any language of your choice.

- Your solution will be scored based on the following criteria:
  1. Correctness
  2. Optimality
  3. Good software practices such as modularity, readability, code quality, documentation (adding a README.md file), etc.
  4. Memory and Run-time efficiency
  5. Elegance
- To submit your solution you can use any of the following methods (they are in the increasing order of brownie points):

  - As a zip file
  - Submit a link to your github repository
  - Fork this repository and create a pull request.

- It would be great if you could design your own solution and explain the logic behind it.
- Achieving feature parity with the [wordle bot](https://ybenhayun.github.io/wordlebot/) would be commendable.

> [!CAUTION]
> If you feel this is a piece of cake for you, develop a solution wherein the bot automatically solves the wordle game for you (Absolutely no human intervention is required).
